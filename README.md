# BTKSADiscordExtended
A mod for ChilloutVR that replaces the built in Discord Rich Presense with one that's more configurable and has some additional features

This mod requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib) or it will not work at all.

There's a couple settings in the BTK Settings menu that can be found in the QuickMenu!

1. Display World Details - This controls if world information such as name, privacy mode, image, and player count are displayed on the rich presence
2. Display Private World Details - This controls if the above information is visible for private (EveryoneCanInvite and OwnerMustInvite) instances
3. Display Username - This controls if your username will be displayed on the rich presence
4. Display Profile Button - This controls if a button linking to your profile on the ABI Hub is visible on the rich presence

If you encounter issues with this mod, feel free to contact me on Discord (DDAkebono)!
